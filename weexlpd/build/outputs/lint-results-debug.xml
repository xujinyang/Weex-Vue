        summary="Package not included in Android"
        explanation="This check scans through libraries looking for calls to APIs that are not included in Android.

When you create Android projects, the classpath is set up such that you can only access classes in the API packages that are included in Android. However, if you add other projects to your libs/ folder, there is no guarantee that those .jar files were built with an Android specific classpath, and in particular, they could be accessing unsupported APIs such as java.applet.

This check scans through library jars and looks for references to API packages that are not included in Android and flags these. This is only an error if your code calls one of the library classes which wind up referencing the unsupported package.">

        summary="Image defined in density-independent drawable folder"
        explanation="The res/drawable folder is intended for density-independent graphics such as shapes defined in XML. For bitmaps, move it to `drawable-mdpi` and consider providing higher and lower resolution versions in `drawable-ldpi`, `drawable-hdpi` and `drawable-xhdpi`. If the icon *really* is density independent (for example a solid color) you can place it in `drawable-nodpi`."

    <issue
        id="RtlHardcoded"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Use &quot;`end`&quot; instead of &quot;`right`&quot; to ensure correct behavior in right-to-left locales"
        category="Internationalization:Bidirectional Text"
        priority="5"
        summary="Using left/right instead of start/end attributes"
        explanation="Using `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#RIGHT` can lead to problems when a layout is rendered in locales where text flows from right to left. Use `Gravity#START` and `Gravity#END` instead. Similarly, in XML `gravity` and `layout_gravity` attributes, use `start` rather than `left`.

For XML attributes such as paddingLeft and `layout_marginLeft`, use `paddingStart` and `layout_marginStart`. *NOTE*: If your `minSdkVersion` is less than 17, you should add *both* the older left/right attributes *as well as* the new start/right attributes. On older platforms, where RTL is not supported and the start/right attributes are unknown and therefore ignored, you need the older left/right attributes. There is a separate lint check which catches that type of error.

(Note: For `Gravity#LEFT` and `Gravity#START`, you can use these constants even when targeting older platforms, because the `start` bitmask is a superset of the `left` bitmask. Therefore, you can use `gravity=&quot;start&quot;` rather than `gravity=&quot;left|start&quot;`.)"
